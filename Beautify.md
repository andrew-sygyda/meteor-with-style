# Beautifying Meteor Projects

Beautifying your code means you get it in shape to meet certain style (or quality) criteria.

A convenient tool to use is [js-beautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify). It can be configured using a `.jsbeautifyrc` file in the root of your project.

Similar to `.editorconfig` it is not capable of automatically meeting every style convention, but most of the big ones.
