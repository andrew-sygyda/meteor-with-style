# Editing with style support

Most editor allow you to define certain style aspects, such as how many spaces to use for indenting code. When using different editors or using different editors it can become quite tedious to manage the correct editor settings by hand. [Editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) is a simple tool to take care of unified editor settings across different editors or machines.

The [list of supported options](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/EditorConfig-Properties) is different between editors.

Note that only a small fraction of what can be part of a style guide can be addressed using editor settings or even editorconfig. Try to include tools to [beautify code adhering to style conventions](Beautify.md).
