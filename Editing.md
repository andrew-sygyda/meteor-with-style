# Editing with style support

Most editor allow you to define certain style aspects, such as how many spaces to use for indenting code. When using different editors or using different editors it can become quite tedious to manage the correct editor settings by hand. [Editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) is a simple tool to take care of unified editor settings across different editors or machines.

The [list of supported options](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/EditorConfig-Properties) is different between editors.
