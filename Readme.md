## Why worry about style?

Good question

## How to find the right style?

A good coding style minimizes ambiguity and makes it easy for team members to read other developer's code.

For Meteor projects it is a good idea to look at [the offical MDG Style Guide](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Meteor-Style-Guide).

## How to enforce a certain style?

Enforcing a certain style requires [supporting editor configuration](Editing.md) as well as tools that are capable of [pointing out violations of style rules](Linting.md).
